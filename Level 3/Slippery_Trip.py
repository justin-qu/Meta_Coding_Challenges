## Problem: Slippery Trip
## There's a grid of cells with R rows (numbered from 1 to R from top to bottom)
## and C columns (numbered from 1 to C from left to right). The grid wraps
## around horizontally, meaning that column 1 is just to the right of column C
## (and column C is just to the left of column 1).

## The cell in row i and column j initially contains one of the following
## (indicated by the character G{i,j}):

##      If G{i,j} = '.', the cell is empty.
##      If G{i,j} = '*', the cell contains a coin.
##      If G{i,j} = '>', the cell contains an arrow pointing right.
##      If G{i,j} = 'v', the cell contains an arrow pointing down.

## You may cyclically shift each row to the right as many times as you'd like
## (including not at all). Each such shift causes each of the row's cells to
## move 1 column to the right, with its rightmost cell (in column C) wrapping
## around and moving to column 1.

## After you've finished rotating the rows to your liking, you'll take a trip
## through the grid, starting by entering the cell at the top-left corner (in
## row 11 and column 11) downward from above the grid. Upon entering a cell, if
## it contains a coin that you haven't yet collected, you'll collect it. If it
## contains an arrow, your direction of travel will change to that of the arrow
## (either right or down). Either way, you'll then proceed to the next adjacent
## cell in your direction of travel. If you move rightward from column C, you'll
## wrap around to column 1 in the same row, and if you move downward from row R,
## you'll end your trip. Note that you may only collect each cell's coin at most
## once, that your trip might last forever, and that once you begin your trip
## you cannot shift the grid's rows further.

## Determine the maximum number of coins you can collect on your trip.

## Constraints:
## 2 <= R, C <= 400,000
## R * C <= 800,000
## G{i, j} âˆˆ {'.', '*', '>', 'v'}

## Solution
## Time Complexity: O(R * C)
## Space Complexity: O(R * C)
## Explanation: In O(C) time, we can iterate through a row and determine the
## maximum number of coins obtainable from the row, whether or not it contains a
## down arrow, and whether or not it only contains right arrows. Using this
## information from each row, we can compute the maximum amount of coins we can
## obtain over all rows. If the row contains a down arrow, then we can simply
## the maximum number of coins obtainable from the row. If it does not, then we
## should decide whether to pass the row by moving down through tile that is
## not a right arrow (but preferably a coin) or taking all the coins in the row
## and ending our run.
