## Problem: Rabbit Hole 1
## You're having a grand old time clicking through the rabbit hole that is your
## favorite online encyclopedia.

## The encyclopedia consists of N different web pages, numbered from 1 to N.
## Each page i contains nothing but a single link to a different page L{i}.

## A session spent on this website involves beginning on one of the N pages,
## and then navigating around using the links until you decide to stop. That is,
## while on page i, you may either move to page L{i}, or stop your browsing
## session.

## Assuming you can choose which page you begin the session on, what's the
## maximum number of different pages you can visit in a single session? Note
## that a page only counts once even if visited multiple times during the
## session.

## Constraints:
## 2 <= N <= 500,000
## 1 <= L{i} <= N
## L{i} â‰  i

## Solution
## Time Complexity: O(N)
## Space Complexity: O(N)
## Explanation: This problem is a depth-first seach problem with a few extra
## steps. While we run DFS, we want to keep track of the number of pages we have
## visited from the starting node S and tag each page with the id of the S.
## Eventually we will reach a visited page X that is either part of the current
## DFS chain (tag equals S) or not. If the tag is the same, then we have a
## cycle. Set the maximum number of pages visitable by any page in a cycle C to
## the number of pages in C and set the tag to a negative value. If the tag is
## different, then we go back up the DFS chain setting the maximum visitable
## value at page P to the maximum number of pages L{P} can visit plus one.
