## Problem: All Wrong
## There's a multiple-choice test with N questions, numbered from 1 to N. Each
## question has 2 answer options, labelled A and B. You know that the correct
## answer for the ith question is the ith character in the string C, which is
## either "A" or "B", but you want to get a score of 0 on this test by answering
## every question incorrectly.

## Your task is to implement the function getWrongAnswers(N, C) which returns a
## string with N characters, the ith of which is the answer you should give for
## question i in order to get it wrong (either "A" or "B").

## Constraints:
## 1 <= N <= 100
## C{i} âˆˆ {'A', 'B'}

## Solution
## Time Complexity: O(N)
## Space Complexity: O(N)
## Explanation: None

def getWrongAnswers(N: int, C: str) -> str:
    wrong_answers = []
  
    for ans in C:
        if ans == 'A':
            wrong_answers.append('B')
        else:
            wrong_answers.append('A')

    return ''.join(wrong_answers)

## Test Cases
if __name__ == "__main__":
    ## Test Case 1
    N = 3
    C = 'ABA'

    print("Test Case 1")
    print("Expected Return Value = BAB")
    print("Actual Return Value   = {}".format(getWrongAnswers(N, C)))
    print("")

    ## Test Case 2
    N = 5
    C = 'BBBBB'

    print("Test Case 2")
    print("Expected Return Value = AAAAA")
    print("Actual Return Value   = {}".format(getWrongAnswers(N, C)))
    print("")
